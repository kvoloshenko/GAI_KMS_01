The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age ... Azure Private 5G Core requires a management network, access network, and up to ten data networks. These networks can all be part of the same, larger network, or they can be separate. The approach you use depends on your traffic separation requirements. For each of these networks, allocate a subnet and then identify the listed IP addresses. A SIM policy takes effect on a UE when it attaches or re-attaches to the network. Therefore, changes to the policy are not dynamically implemented on existing UE sessions. However, if a SIM policy is removed from a UE's SIM, then Azure Private 5G Core will perform a network-initiated detach, disconnecting the UE from the network. Prerequisites The 5G radio access network (RAN) is added to the existing 4G network, which can allow for faster data speeds and lower latency compared to 4G. Standalone Mode (SA) in 5G. SA mode, as the name suggests, is a fully independent 5G deployment. In SA mode, both the 5G RAN and the 5G core network are deployed, enabling the full capabilities of 5G ... What is 5G? Simply put, 5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology. It's the newest global standard in a vast line of mobile network standards, including 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G. This technology delivers high-speed, low-latency connectivity to not only your mobile device, but to all of those handy Internet of Things (IoT) devices at home, like camera doorbells, app-controlled lights, smart ...
