The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age ... The 5G radio access network (RAN) is added to the existing 4G network, which can allow for faster data speeds and lower latency compared to 4G. Standalone Mode (SA) in 5G. SA mode, as the name suggests, is a fully independent 5G deployment. In SA mode, both the 5G RAN and the 5G core network are deployed, enabling the full capabilities of 5G ... A SIM policy takes effect on a UE when it attaches or re-attaches to the network. Therefore, changes to the policy are not dynamically implemented on existing UE sessions. However, if a SIM policy is removed from a UE's SIM, then Azure Private 5G Core will perform a network-initiated detach, disconnecting the UE from the network. Prerequisites We show a complete development covering how to prepare the operating system for the installation of the 5G next-generation node B (gNB) and how to install and deploy the 5G-SA software components. We evaluate the performance, indoor coverage range, and power consumption of our system with measurements. Apart from that, SA 5G offers far better speed than NSA 5G. It can theoretically achieve a download speed of 10 to 20 Gbps. So, the insane claims of being able to download a 1GB movie in 5 seconds or so might actually come true. SA 5G network can scale massively and can handle more than 1 million devices at a time.
