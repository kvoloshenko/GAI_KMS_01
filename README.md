# GenAI-Powered Knowledge Management System 
(GAI_KMS_01)

This is a prototype of a solution like 
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based on LangGraph with data from Jira and Confluence

## Description

![GenAI_Powered_KMS_02.png](Images%2FGenAI_Powered_KMS_02.png)

The "GenAI-Powered Knowledge Management System" is designed to streamline and optimize the management of knowledge within an organization using advanced AI capabilities.

**1. User Interaction:**

* **User**: The process starts with the User who asks a question to the AI agents.
* **GenAI_Agent**: The GenAI Agents are key components, receiving questions from the users and providing answers.

**2. Context Management:**

* **Data Context**: The GenAI Agents interact with the Data Context hosted on the Chat history. They both receive context data and update it as needed, ensuring up-to-date information flow.

**3. Tool Utilization:**

* **Search Tool & Summary Tool**: To provide accurate and relevant answers, GenAI Agents use the Search and Summary tools. These tools interact with Vector Databases to retrieve relevant chunks of information.

**4. External Search:**

* **WebSearch**: In addition to internal data, the GenAI Agents can perform web searches to gather additional information that may be relevant to the user's question.

**5. Data Ingestion:**

* **Document Loaders**: These components populate Vector Databases with data from various source systemsâ€”Jira, Confluence, and Git, ensuring that the GenAI agents have a rich dataset to work with.


This architecture enables seamless data integration and intelligent query resolution, leveraging both structured internal data and external resources to enhance knowledge management.

# Implementation

## 0.Synthetic data generation

### 0.1. Generate synthetic data in JSON format to emulate Confluence data.
_01_SyntheticDataGeneration_Confluence.py_ script will generate the requested number of synthetic data entries, 
complete with metadata and descriptions, and save them to the specified JSON file.

The data is dedicated to the description of a fictitious software product called "Moon Flight System".

### 0.2. Generates synthetic data in CSV format to emulate Jira data.

_02_SyntheticDataGeneration_Jira.py_ script uses the Faker library to generate realistic random data for various fields.

The data contains Jira ticket information for a fictitious software product called "Moon Flight System".

### 1.1. Creating a new Vector Knowledge Base for Jira

#### Nodes and Edges

We can lay out an agentic RAG graph like this:

* The state is a set of messages
* Each node will update (append to) state
* Conditional edges decide which node to visit next
